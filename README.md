# Accessible Amy
### A Simon Remix

## Theme - Accessibility
Simon is a game of memory where the user must replay the randomly generated sequence each round. The CPU will add a randomized color to the sequence. Once the user input does not match the CPU sequence, the game ends. 

The theme of Accessible Amy is to allow individuals with disabilities to enjoy the game. While the trasitional Simon uses three reference points to aid in memory - color, sound, and positon - individuals who are monochromatic color-blind are only able to use two reference points - sound and position. Accessible Amy seeks to replace the traditional color reference with a pattern/texture reference.
